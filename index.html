	<h1>She :</h1>
	
	<p>
		<span>Me to her:</span> I don't know how it happened can't tell you the in-betweens or the start, perhaps our path was miraculously woven to trap us into each other's heart. You became the reason I got my laugh back, the reason I fell asleep with a smiile on my face, the reason I had the motivation to do things again, the reason why my problems don't seems so bad. You truly have made my life better by just being in it. I used to fall in love with you  everyday, a little more than the previous day  untill I realize my love for you has no boundaries, no limits. It is infinite.I want you to know that I choose you and I'll keep choosing you over and over and over, without pause, without a doubt. I'll never get enough of exploring who you are. You are the most universal soul I've ever known. 
		If it is possible I would take your pain and carry it for you just so you could fell yourself again. At the end I just want you to know that I love you and keep loving you till my last breath so I want you. All of you.Your flaws. Your mistakes. Your imperfactions.I want you,and only you.
